Public Key Infrastructure

Overview
========
1. A two key encryption system for communication
2. A framework, a set of rules
3. Provides authentication and confidentiality
   Authentication: Confirms the owner of the keys using "Digital Certificates" (DC solves the problem of someone pretending to be Alice and sending me the malicious public key.)
   Confidentiality: Encrypts data transmissions (I send message to Alice who has a public and private key pair. I request the public key and get it. I encrypt the message with the public key. She decrypts the message with the private key.)
4. It is used all over the web in the form of SSL certificates. Verifying who you are interacting with is important when shopping on line.

=========
1. Digital Certificates:
   Helps with authentication
   Associates a public key with an individual/company
   Issued by a Certificate Authority
2. Certificate Authorities (CA)
   Is a server responsible for zissuing, revoking and distributing certificates
   Often a trusted third-party organization like VeriSign, but companies or organizations can have an in-house CA
  ?Stores the public key in a directory that is available to anyone that wants to verify your certificate
3. Registration Authorities (RA)
   Acts as a secretory of CA

3. How PKI works
================
1. Alice registered and have a digital certificate with CA
2. I request Alice's certificate from the CA (one of CA's responsibilities is to distribute the certs) [Or Alice could send the certificate by herself. But how do we know it belongs to Alice that is signed by a CA. And we trust the CA]
3. CA sends Alice's certificate to me. I encrypt my message using Alice's verified public key contained within the certificate
4. Alice decrypts the message with her private key
